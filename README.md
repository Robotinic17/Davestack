## Project Overview

**Project Name:** DAVESTACK – Personal Portfolio  
**Developer:** Eluwole David Timileyin  
**Status:** Complete and deployed  
**Purpose:** Showcase frontend skills, projects, and design philosophy in a clean, modern format.

## Design Philosophy

### Neumorphic (Soft UI) Approach

- Subtle dual-shadow system to simulate depth
- Raised and inset components for interaction feedback
- Rounded corners for a soft, tactile interface
- Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

### Color System

**Light Mode**

- Background: `#c3d4ec`
- Text: `#1a1a1a`
- Accent: `#667eea → #764ba2`

**Dark Mode**

- Background: `#1e1e2f`
- Text: `#f5f5f5`
- Accent: `#7c3aed → #a78bfa`

---

## Features

- Light and dark mode toggle with persistence
- Neumorphic UI components across the interface
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Sidebar navigation with active state tracking
- Animated gradient blobs and particle background
- Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Optimized structure for performance and readability

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 for layout, styling, and neumorphism
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and state management
- Vercel for deployment and hosting

No frameworks. No UI libraries. Pure fundamentals.
